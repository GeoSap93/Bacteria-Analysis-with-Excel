Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation
I used a new excel sheet to clean the row data. Firstly, I remove duplicates and trimed whitespaces. Next, I used the function unique() so that I find all the bacteria names and families. I also used the same function to identify all the unique places bacteria can be found. As some bacteria are harmful for human and some are not, I used if() to specify the harmful bacteria as 0 and the non harmful as 1.
