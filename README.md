# Bacteria Analysis using Excel

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation

I utilized a new Excel spreadsheet to organize the row data. Initially, I eliminated duplicate entries and removed extra spaces. Following that, I employed the unique() function to compile a comprehensive list of bacteria names and families. Additionally, I used the same function to identify the various locations where bacteria can be located. To distinguish between harmful and non-harmful bacteria, I employed the if() function to label the harmful bacteria as 0 and the non-harmful bacteria as 1.

Stage 2: Data Analysis

After completing the data cleaning process, I transitioned to data analysis. I identified the total quantity of bacteria present, categorized them by their respective families, and detailed their various locations. Additionally, I conducted an assessment to determine the quantity of bacteria that pose a threat to human health versus those that do not.

Stage 3: Data Visualization & Communication

- Pie Chart: How many bacteria are harmful to humans?

  Upon reviewing the visualization, it is evident that 47.7% of the bacteria included in the current list are classified as harmful to humans, while the remaining 52.3% are deemed beneficial.

- Bar Chart: Where can you find bacteria that are neutral for human?

Various types of bacteria inhabit a range of environments, including contaminated water, water systems, and infected animals, which can pose health risks to humans. Additionally, bacteria located on the skin, nasal passages, throat, and lungs can also be harmful. In contrast, bacteria that are part of the human body, such as those found in the intestines, uninfected wounds, and ecosystems like freshwater, hot springs, sugary, salty, and deep-sea environments, as well as salt lakes and even radioactive environments, are not harmful to us. This analysis demonstrates that certain bacteria that coexist with us or in our surroundings play a crucial and beneficial role in our survival.
