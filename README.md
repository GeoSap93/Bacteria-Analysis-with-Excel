# Bacteria Analysis using Excel

Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation

I used a new excel sheet to clean the row data. Firstly, I remove duplicates and trimed whitespaces. Next, I used the function unique() so that I find all the bacteria names and families. I also used the same function to identify all the unique places bacteria can be found. As some bacteria are harmful for human and some are not, I used if() to specify the harmful bacteria as 0 and the non harmful as 1.

Stage 2: Data Analysis

After cleaning my data, I moved to data analysis. I found the total amount of bacteria, the families and all the different places bacteria can be found. Furthermore, I calculated the amount of bacteria that are harmful for human and the ones that are not. 

Stage 3: Data Visualization & Communication

# Pie Chart: How many bacteria are harmful to humans?

By looking at the visualization, 47.7% of the bacteria in the current list are harmful for humans when the rest 52.3% is beneficial for us.

# Bar Chart: Where can you find bacteria that are neutral for human?

There are bacteria that live in different environments like contaminated water, water systems and infected animals that are harmful for our body. Also, bacteria that are found on skin, nasal passages, throat, lungs etc. can be harmful too. On the contrary, bacteria that belong to the human body, intestines,unfected wounds or ecosystems with freshwater, hot springs, sugary, salty and deep see environments, salt lakes, even radioactive environments are not harmful for us. This analysis shows that some bacteria that live with us or in our surroundings are important and essential for our survival.
